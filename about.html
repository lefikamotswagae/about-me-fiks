    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Thabang Molaba, and I am an actor, model, and musician from South Africa. My journey in the entertainment industry is deeply rooted in the values my family instilled in me: hard work, perseverance, and the courage to chase my dreams. Growing up in a supportive household, I was always encouraged to pursue my passions, which led me to discover my love for performing arts.</p>
    <p>My family has been my greatest source of strength, shaping me into the person I am today. Their unwavering belief in me gave me the confidence to step into the spotlight, first as a model and later as an actor, landing roles that have allowed me to express myself and inspire others. Because of them, I continue to push boundaries, grow in my craft, and stay true to who I am.</p>
